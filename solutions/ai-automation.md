## Overview

We turn repetitive, rules-based tasks into automated workflows powered by AI and your existing tooling. Each automation is scoped with clear guardrails so you keep visibility and quality intact.

## Typical Automations

- Lead qualification assistants that sync with your CRM and alert sales when signals are hot.
- Content operations pipelines that draft, summarize, and tag assets for human review.
- Support desk copilots that triage tickets, surface answers, and create escalation playbooks.
- Internal dashboards that stitch together data sources to highlight blockers and wins.

## Implementation Approach

We start by mapping the current workflow and quantifying the time cost. Then we design a proof of concept, integrate with your tools (Slack, Notion, HubSpot, custom APIs), and gradually scale adoption with training, prompts, and monitoring.
