## Webflow

### Why choose it

Webflow is our go-to when you need full design control without sacrificing performance. It’s ideal for brands that care about aesthetics but also need speed, clarity, and a strong SEO-ready foundation from day one.

### Pros

- Full design freedom without rigid templates.
- Clean, semantic code output — excellent for technical SEO.
- Fast load times and great Core Web Vitals performance.
- Native animations and interactions without external plugins.
- Easy visual content editing using Webflow Editor.
- Perfect for teams that value both design and performance.

### Cons

- Can require support when working with more advanced content structures (e.g., linking services to related case studies or blog articles).
- Higher learning curve for clients who want to fully self-manage.
- Not ideal for robust or complex e-commerce setups.
- Geared towards larger, design-driven websites with multiple feedback rounds — which usually leads to longer development timelines and higher costs for design iterations.

### Getting Started

At Doop UX, we start with a clear audit of your goals and content. We define the site map, SEO priorities, wireframes, and design. Then we build everything in Webflow with precision, following best practices in both UX and SEO. You end up with a fast, editable site — solid, scalable, and designed to grow with you.

## Squarespace

### Why choose it

Squarespace is ideal for businesses that are just starting out and need a professional online presence without dealing with technical complexity. It’s a great option for clients who are still defining their content or brand, but want to get their site live quickly. Recommended for those who prefer to self-manage the site once development is complete.

### Pros

- All-in-one platform with built-in features: hosting, forms, blog, scheduling, e-commerce, newsletter, and more.
- Great for early-stage businesses or tight budgets.
- Very easy to maintain — you can edit text, images, and sections without any technical knowledge.
- Fast to launch with a professional look — if your content is ready, you can go live in 2–3 days.
- Clean, modern, responsive templates.
- Solid foundation that’s editable and scalable without technical overhead.

### Cons

- Limited layout flexibility — you’re confined to pre-defined blocks and templates.
- Not suitable for highly custom visual designs or complex integrations.
- Less control over technical SEO (though we optimize structure and content for best results).
- Not recommended for large dynamic content structures.
- Includes e-commerce, but not ideal for large product catalogs or detailed inventory control.
- Visual customizations beyond the standard options require CSS adjustments.

### Getting Started

At Doop UX, we guide you through the essentials — content structure, page hierarchy, and key design priorities. We deliver a clean, flexible site aligned with your brand. Once online, we provide training so you can manage everything yourself: update content, launch new sections, or sell products independently.

## BigCommerce

### Why choose it

BigCommerce is a robust e-commerce platform built for brands that want to scale their online store from day one. It’s ideal if you have a large product catalog, need advanced inventory logic, and want native integrations with payment gateways, shipping systems, and marketplaces — all without relying on third-party plugins.

### Pros

- Built for large stores with complex product structures and inventory management.
- Strong native integrations with Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping, and more.
- Solid technical SEO structure out of the box.
- Excellent performance and fast loading speeds.
- Advanced customization options through templates and code access.
- Full-featured backend: manage orders, customers, discounts, taxes, and reports in one place.

### Cons

- Not ideal for early-stage businesses or small product catalogs.
- The admin interface is functional but not as modern or intuitive as Shopify.
- Visual customization is more limited unless you bring in a developer.
- Some integrations may require technical assistance.
- Higher initial and maintenance costs compared to simpler platforms.

### Getting Started

At Doop UX, we work closely with you to understand your product structure, business logic, and automation needs. We create a scalable e-commerce foundation with a clear structure, optimized performance, and an intuitive shopping experience — built to grow with your brand.

## Shopify

### Why choose it

Shopify is the best choice if you want to sell online professionally without technical complexity. Its intuitive interface and extensive ecosystem make it easy to scale — from a simple shop to a full operation with multiple sales channels. Perfect for entrepreneurs who want clarity, speed, and control over their store.

### Pros

- Extremely user-friendly, even for beginners.
- Great for small to medium-sized stores looking to grow fast.
- Vast ecosystem of ready-to-use apps and integrations.
- Built-in support for payments, shipping, taxes — optimized for Australia and international markets.
- Seamless selling on Instagram, Facebook, Google, TikTok, and more.
- Clean, modern themes with flexible visual customization.
- Reliable performance, scalability, and security.

### Cons

- Less control over the underlying code and technical SEO compared to Webflow or BigCommerce.
- Many essential features require third-party apps, increasing monthly costs.
- Advanced design customization requires knowledge of Liquid (Shopify's templating language).
- Not ideal for very large catalogs with complex stock logic — BigCommerce may be better in that case.

### Getting Started

At Doop UX, we help you launch with clarity and confidence. From store structure and product setup to payment, shipping, and design — we take care of everything. Once live, we train you to manage your store smoothly so you can focus on growing your business.

## Shopify vs BigCommerce: How to Choose

Both platforms are powerful and designed for serious e-commerce. But choosing the right one depends on your business model, experience, and long-term goals.

### Choose **Shopify** if:

- You want to launch quickly with minimal technical effort.
- You prefer a clean, modern, and easy-to-use admin interface.
- You plan to sell via social media and multiple sales channels.
- You have a small to medium product catalog with simple inventory needs.
- You want to self-manage your store without relying on developers.

### Choose **BigCommerce** if:

- You have a large product catalog with complex variants or pricing rules.
- You need detailed stock control, advanced shipping logic, or B2B features.
- You're planning to integrate with Amazon, eBay, or other marketplaces at scale.
- Your team has technical support or you’re working with an experienced partner.
- You’re building a more robust operation from the start and want total control.

### Our Take at Doop

We don’t push one over the other — we help you choose based on your actual business needs, future plans, and operational flow. The right platform should support your growth without friction or unnecessary complexity.

## Node + Strapi JS

### Why choose it

This is the right path if you want **total control and complete customization**. With technologies like **Node.js** and **Strapi** (a headless CMS), we build digital products that scale with no limitations and no platform lock-in, no monthly fees, and no dependency on visual builders.

This setup is ideal when:

- You don’t want to be tied to a closed platform or proprietary builder.
- You need full design flexibility from wireframes to pixel-perfect implementation.
- Your business logic or integrations are complex and require custom workflows.
- You’re thinking long-term and want a product you fully own and control.
- You want a backend that connects directly with external APIs, systems, CRMs, or automations.

### Pros

- 100% custom — from UX wireframes to backend logic.
- No platform fees or ecosystem lock-in.
- Native API integrations and real backend logic from the ground up.
- Structured content system: multilingual, role-based access, flexible relationships.
- Full control over SEO technical structure and performance at the server level.
- Built with open-source technologies used by millions of developers worldwide.
- Future-proof and scalable — you’re not tied to us or a small dev team.

### Cons

- Not plug-and-play — it requires planning, design, and real development work.
- Longer development timeline than platforms like Squarespace or Shopify.
- Not recommended if you just need a quick brochure-style site.
- Ongoing support is optional but advisable for evolving needs or scaling.

### Getting Started

At Doop UX, we approach these projects holistically. We define your product architecture, user flows, and visual language — then bring it to life using modern development standards. It’s a serious solution for businesses that see technology as a long-term asset, not just a website.

## WordPress Migration

### Why migrate

After 15 years of working with WordPress, we’ve seen its evolution up close. Originally built as a blogging platform, WordPress has grown by stacking features and plugins to meet a wide range of use cases — from e-commerce to memberships, booking systems, directories, and more.

Today, WordPress still powers over 40% of the web*, but that doesn’t necessarily make it the best tool for every business. It was never designed from the ground up to support all these complex functionalities. As a result, most WordPress sites are held together by layers of third-party plugins, workarounds, and visual builders that can lead to serious long-term limitations.

### Common issues we see:

- Slow performance and bloated code.
- Plugins with poor support or complete abandonment.
- Frequent security vulnerabilities due to outdated or conflicting components.
- A backend experience that feels outdated compared to modern platforms.
- Ongoing hidden costs in maintenance, backups, and security fixes.

### Our take at Doop UX

We don’t start new projects in WordPress anymore. However, we **do offer seamless migration support** for clients who are currently on WordPress and want to move to a more modern, stable, and scalable solution.

Depending on your business needs, we recommend migrating to:

- **Webflow** – for fast, SEO-ready, visually controlled sites.
- **Shopify or BigCommerce** – if your core focus is e-commerce.
- **Squarespace** – if you want simplicity and ease of use.
- **Strapi or even Laravel** – if you need a fully custom backend and total technical freedom.

We handle your migration carefully: preserving your content, maintaining your SEO ranking, and improving the overall user experience. You won’t just get a “copy” of your old site — you’ll get a cleaner, more efficient, and future-proof version.
