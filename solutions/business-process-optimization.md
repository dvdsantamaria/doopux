## Overview

Your team already has processes — they just live in people’s heads or ad-hoc docs. We document, refine, and automate those workflows so everyone understands their role and work moves faster.

## Deliverables

- End-to-end process maps that highlight bottlenecks and handoff friction.
- Standard operating procedures with clear triggers, owners, and quality checks.
- Tooling recommendations and integrations that remove duplicate data entry.
- Dashboards that track leading indicators, SLAs, and throughput.

## Change Management

Optimization fails without adoption. We co-create playbooks with your team, run training, and set up feedback loops so improvements stick and improvements continue after our engagement.
