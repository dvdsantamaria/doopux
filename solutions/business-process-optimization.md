### Why small businesses struggle with processes

Solo founders and lean teams often juggle sales, service, admin, and marketing all at once. Everything lives in someone’s head or a patchwork of spreadsheets. That works at first, but it breaks the moment demand spikes or a key person is unavailable.

Mid-size and large companies solve this with ERPs, formal SOP manuals, and dedicated process owners. For a five-person team, those solutions feel overkill — yet the underlying need for consistency and visibility is exactly the same.

### Typical workflows we formalise for small teams

- **Lead-to-Sale Pipeline**

From first inquiry to signed proposal, every touchpoint is mapped and automated, so no lead slips through the cracks.

- **Client Onboarding**

A checklist in Notion or Airtable triggers welcome emails, contract signatures, and kickoff calls — ensuring a great first impression without relying on memory.

- **Inventory & Reorder Cycle**

For cafes, boutiques, or micro-warehouses: simple low-stock alerts and supplier templates keep shelves full without overbuying.

- **Invoicing & Cash-Flow Rhythm**

Recurring invoices, payment reminders, and automatic reconciliation reduce admin hours and improve liquidity.

- **Content Production Calendar**

A visual board schedules blog posts, social updates, and email newsletters, linking tasks, assets, and deadlines in one place.

### How we build your processes — step by step

**1. Discovery & Shadowing**

We observe how work actually happens — screens shared, conversations listened to, bottlenecks noted.

**2. Visual Mapping**

Every task becomes a node in a clear flowchart. You see where hand-offs fail and where automation can step in.

**3. Tool Selection & Setup**

We choose lightweight, affordable tools (Notion, Airtable, Google Workspace, Zapier, Slack) that fit your tech comfort and budget.

**4. Pilot & Training**

A small slice of the workflow goes live first. Your team tests it, we collect feedback, refine, then roll out the full process.

**5. Review & Continuous Support**

For the first 60 days we monitor metrics like task completion time, error rate, and team adoption. Adjustments are made in real time.
