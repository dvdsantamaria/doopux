## Overview

Growth isn’t a single tactic — it’s a process. We align product, marketing, and sales around the same goals and run disciplined experiments that deliver learning cycles instead of vanity metrics.

## Key Activities

- Market and customer research that validates positioning and messaging.
- Offer architecture with pricing, packaging, and value props tested in-market.
- Experiment design across funnels (acquisition, activation, retention, referral).
- Analytics readouts that connect experiment results to pipeline and revenue.

## Collaboration Model

We embed with your team through stand-ups and async updates, sharing playbooks and frameworks so you can continue iterating after the engagement ends.
