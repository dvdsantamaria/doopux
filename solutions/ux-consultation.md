## UX Consultation & Reports

*We analyse your website and deliver actionable recommendations to improve usability, engagement, and conversions.*

---

### Do any of these sound familiar?

1. Why does your site look great but still get low traffic — even with paid campaigns?
2. Why are you investing in technical SEO but still not ranking well in your industry?
3. Why are customers abandoning their carts before completing checkout?
4. Why is nobody filling out your contact form, even when they land on the right page?
5. Why does your mobile experience frustrate users and drive them to your competitors?
6. Why is your bounce rate so high even though the content seems relevant?
7. Why haven’t recent design changes led to more sales or leads?

These issues don’t get solved with “more traffic” or a quick redesign.

They require understanding how people actually **experience** your site — and applying UX strategically.

### 🔍 What’s included in your **UX Report**

**1. Usability Assessment**

We identify friction points and areas that confuse users such as unclear menus, overwhelming layouts, or poorly placed buttons.

**→ Example:** If nobody fills out your contact form or users struggle on mobile, we show exactly where and why they drop off.

**2. User Flow Optimisation**

We analyse key processes like checkout, sign-up, or booking flows to remove unnecessary steps and simplify interactions.

**→ Example:** If customers abandon their cart, we pinpoint friction in the flow and suggest ways to streamline the experience.

**3. Design & Accessibility Review**

We evaluate visual hierarchy, typography, color usage, and design consistency. We also provide optional accessibility improvements.

**→ Example:** If your site looks nice but suffers from poor readability or contrast, we recommend small adjustments that reduce bounce rate and boost SEO.

**4. User Behaviour Insights**

We use tools like **Hot-jar** and **Microsoft Clarity** to analyse how users interact with your site: clicks, scrolls, hesitations, and drop-offs.

**→ Example:** If users engage with certain content but ignore others, we help you understand what’s working and what’s pushing them away.

**5. Comparison with Best Practices**

We benchmark your site against UX and industry standards, as well as your direct competitors.

**→ Example:** If you’ve invested in SEO but aren't ranking, UX gaps may be holding you back — we show you how to close them.

**6. Actionable Recommendations**

You’ll receive a prioritised checklist of improvements: from quick wins to high-impact and long-term changes.

**→ Example:** If a recent redesign didn’t improve conversions, we explain what to fix first and why it matters.

**7. Business Benefits**

Every UX improvement is connected to real business goals like higher conversions, lower churn, and stronger brand perception.

**→ Example:** Even small UX upgrades can significantly increase sales, retention, and customer satisfaction.

### Why UX matters

The “Magnificent 7” — Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, and Tesla — all build around one principle:

**User Experience is not optional. It’s core strategy.**

A great UX turns visitors into customers and customers into advocates.

A poor UX silently pushes people away — without you or your team even realising it.

### Why small businesses struggle with UX — and how Doop UX helps

- Lack of time or resources for proper testing.
- The belief that “looking nice” is enough, or that “my product sells offline — I don’t need much online.”
- Overreliance on templates or poorly chosen plugins that don’t match your business flow.
- UX is rarely prioritised compared to day-to-day urgencies.

But here’s the truth:

**UX isn’t something we do *for* you — it’s something we build *with* you.**

It requires understanding, collaboration, and a commitment to long-term growth.

Yes, it takes time and effort — but it’s one of the most effective investments your business can make.
