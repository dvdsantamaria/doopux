### Why this service exists

Many founders have a promising idea but no clear roadmap. They need to **validate fast** without burning time or money. We provide a structured yet flexible process that combines lean principles, real-world research, and proven tools to reach the market quickly.

### Our 10-step sprint

**1. Kick-off Workshop**

We translate your raw idea into an initial value proposition, define who the first users are, and agree on success signals (no complex KPIs, just practical goals).

**2. Rapid Research & Benchmarking**

In 72 hours we study competitors, adjacent products, and user pain points. You receive a concise report that highlights gaps and winning patterns.

**3. Lean Canvas & Scope Freeze**

Together we map the problem, solution, unfair advantage, and revenue logic. We lock an MVP scope that can be built and launched within the sprint window.

**4. Tool Stack Selection**

Where possible we leverage existing, battle-tested services (Firebase, Supabase, Airtable, Stripe, Zapier, Vercel, etc.) to slash development time and cost.

**5. Notion Board Setup**

All tasks, files, and timelines live in a shared Notion workspace with Kanban lanes, deadlines, and owners. Everyone always knows what’s next.

**6. Design Sprint**

Wireframes → high-fidelity mockups → interactive prototype. Daily reviews keep momentum and ensure every screen has a purpose.

**7. Build Sprint**

We code in short cycles, push increments to a staging URL, and invite you to click, break, and comment. Typical duration: 10–15 dev days.

**8. User Testing & Iteration**

We collect feedback from real users (5–7 testers are enough for 85 % of issues) and ship quick fixes before launch.

**9. Soft Launch**

The MVP goes live on production. Analytics, error tracking, and lightweight funnels are pre-configured so you can measure traction from day one.

**10. Continuous Support**

For four additional weeks we stay on standby to patch, optimise, or extend features while you gather market data.
